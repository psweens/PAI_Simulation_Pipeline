# Photoacoustic Simulation Pipeline Using SIMPA, MCX, and k-Wave

This repository provides a simulation pipeline for generating synthetic photoacoustic imaging data using:
- [SIMPA](https://github.com/IMSY-DKFZ/simpa) for modeling **light transport and optical absorption**,
- [MCX](http://mcx.space/) as the **Monte Carlo simulation engine** for photon propagation,
- [k-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org/) for **acoustic propagation and image reconstruction**.

It operates on synthetic 3D segmentation masks of vasculature and produces reconstructed photoacoustic volumes.

## üß† Workflow Summary

1. üß¨ **Optical Simulation (`OpticalSimulations.py`)**
   - Uses SIMPA + MCX to simulate optical fluence and compute the initial pressure distribution.

2. üîä **Acoustic Reconstruction (`Reconstruction.m`)**
   - Uses k-Wave (in MATLAB) to simulate acoustic wave propagation and reconstruct photoacoustic images.

## üåø Synthetic Vasculature Input

The vascular segmentation masks used as input for simulation are generated using the  
[V-System](https://github.com/psweens/V-System) ‚Äî a synthetic vessel generation framework.

This simulation pipeline was originally developed to support the **[VAN-GAN](https://github.com/psweens/VAN-GAN)** project, a deep learning framework for reconstructing vascular structures from photoacoustic data.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Step 1: Optical Simulation (Python + SIMPA + MCX)

```bash
python OpticalSimulations.py
```

Ensure:
- A 3D vascular segmentation mask (`.npy` or `.mat`) is available.
- MCX is installed and accessible in the system path.
- SIMPA is set to use MCX as the photon transport backend.

### Step 2: Acoustic Reconstruction (MATLAB + k-Wave)

In MATLAB:

```matlab
Reconstruction
```

Make sure:
- The input `.mat` path matches the output from Python.
- k-Wave is correctly installed and functional.

---

## üì∑ Output

- Output includes `.mat` files of reconstructed images.
- These can be visualized using MATLAB or Python tools.

## üß™ Example Use Case

This pipeline is ideal for:
- Validating photoacoustic reconstruction methods
- Generating paired data for training deep learning models (e.g. VAN-GAN)
- Exploring the influence of vascular morphology on image contrast
